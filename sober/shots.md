```shell
Am I out of touch
Am I out of my please
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
I'm wishing you're here
But I wishing you're gone
I can't have you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
I'm gonna mess this up this is just my life
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for enerything everything I've done
From the second day I was born I think I had a loaded gun
And I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved 
I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck
Am I waiting to break
When I keep saying that I'm looking for a way to escape
I'm wishing I had
What I've taken for granted
I cant' have you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
I'm gonna mess this up this is just my life
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for enerything everything I've done
From the second day I was born I think I had a loaded gun
And I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved 
I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road side we used to know
We can let this drift away
we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
we let this drift away
Cause you're always got to change your mind
Cause you're always got to change your mind 
love, can you hear me?
let it drift away
I'm sorry for enerything everything I've done
From the second day I was born I think I had a loaded gun
And I shot shot shot a hole through everything I loved 
I shot shot shot a hole through every single thing that I loved
In the mean time, we let it go
At the road side we used to know
We can let this drift away
we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
we let this drift away
Cause you're always got to change your mind
Cause you're always got to change your mind 
love, can you hear me?
