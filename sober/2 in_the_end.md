It starts with one thing
有件事从始至终
I don't know why
我从未明白过
It doesn't even matter
无论我如何挣扎努力
How hard you try
却没有一丝效果
Keep that in mind
在我脑海中
I designed this rhyme
只能铭记下这首疑歌
To explain in due time
合适的时机解析自我
All I know
但我明白
Time is a valuable thing
时间何等珍贵
Watch it fly by
白驹过隙
As the pendulum swings
如挂钟摇摆
Watch it count down
开始倒数
To the end of the day
直到终结
The clock ticks life away
人生会随时间起伏改变
It's so unreal
犹如无知觉的梦境
Didn't look out below
过程超乎你的掌控
Watch the time go
凝望时光
Right out the window
看它从窗棂悄然遁走
Trying to hold on,
试图挽留
But didn't even know
可我不曾领悟
Wasted it all just
时间不等人
To watch you go
只能默默望着你的离去
I kept everything inside and
将一切铭存于心
Even though I tried,
即使锲而不舍，披奏坚韧之铠
It all fell apart
最后努力却轻易分崩离析
What it meant to me will
对我来说
Eventually be a
最好的结果
Memory of a time when
便是把这段固执信念深埋
I tried so hard
我曾努力挣扎
And got so far
走到现今
But in the end
最终才发现
It doesn't even matter
原来都无济于事
I had to fall
不可控制的
To lose it all
失去了所有
But in the end
最终才明白
It doesn't even matter
前途渺茫
One thing,
有件事
I don't know why
我不曾明白
It doesn’t even matter
无论你如何竭尽全力
How hard you try,
为什么却于事无补
Keep that in mind
在我脑海深处
I designed this rhyme,
撰写下这首疑歌
To remind myself how
时刻警醒自己
I tried so hard
我曾经努力过
In spite of the way
但我所谓的信念
You were mocking me
你却只会嘲笑
Acting like I was
可我的灵魂
Part of your property
早已全然属于你
Remembering all the
曾经历历在目
Times you fought with me
那潸然动容的瞬间
I'm surprised it got so (far)
如今却是过往云烟
Things aren't the way
万事皆变，物是人非
They were before
再此重逢
You wouldn't even
你或许
Recognise me anymore
早已不再认识我
Not that you
并非是你的过错
Knew me back then
而是我已改变
But it all comes
但是过去的一切
Back to me (in the end)
都有可能重蹈覆辙
You kept everything inside
你把一切抛之脑后
And even though I tried,
我曾挣扎过
It all fell apart
但一切徒劳
What it meant to me will
对我来说
Eventually be a
这段记忆
Memory of a time when I
我只能掩埋在深处
I tried so hard
我曾努力挣扎
And got so far
走到至今
But in the end
最终才发现
It doesn't even matter
一切都徒劳
I had to fall
不受我的控制
To lose it all
失去了所有
But in the end
最终才明白
It doesn't even matter
一切都无用
I've put my trust in you
我把信任托付于你
Pushed as far as I can go
尽我所能去努力
For all this
对于这一切
There's only one thing you should know
有件事你应该明白
I've put my trust in you
我把感情托付于你
Pushed as far as I can go
便会尽我所能去投入
For all this
对于这一切
There's only one thing you should know
你知道这件事便已足够
I tried so hard
我曾努力过
And got so far
走到这不可挽回的一步
But in the end
最终才看透
It doesn't even matter
一切都是徒劳
I had to fall
沉沦于此
To lose it all
失去所有
But in the end
最终才看透
It doesn't even matter
一切都是徒劳
